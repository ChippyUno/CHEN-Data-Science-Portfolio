## Project 1: Streamlit App for Interactive Data Visualization
Streamlit is a Python library that allows users to build interactive web applications for data science and machine learning. It is very helpful in creating visualizations and interactive tools without additional knowledge about front-end development

### Features/Functions
* Interactive Options: Customized sliders, buttons, dropdowns, and more.
* Data Visualizations: Works with many Python libraries to generate visuals
* Simplicity: Easily writes web apps without additional scripts

## Project 2: Tidy Data Cleaning and Visualization 
This project focuses on transforming raw data into a tidy format for better analysis and visualization. Using the 2008 Olympics medalist dataset, the project applies data cleaning techniques and restructuring principles to ensure that:
* Each vairable is stored in its own column
* Each observation has its own row
* Each type of observational unit forms its own table

The project also includes data visualizations and aggregation techniques to showcase insights from the cleaned dataset. This project demonstrates strong data-wrangling skills and reinforces the importance of structured data for analysis.

### Portfolio Growth
Adding the Tidy Data project alongside the Streamlit App enhances this portfolio by demonstrating both backend data processing skills and frontend visualization capabilities. The first project showcases proficiency in data cleaning and transformation, while the second highlights the ability to build interactive applications. This combination strengthens the overall coding profile, making it more comprehensive and practical for real-world applications

## Project 3: Streamlit App
This streamlit app serves as an interactive machine learning envrionment that allows users to upload their own datasets or explore built-in ones, select a model, tune hyperparameters, adn visualize performance metrics like ROC curves adn confusion matrices. It deepened my understanding of model evaluation, preprocessing, and the practical impact of hyperparameter tuning. 

### Portfolio Growth
By deploying this app on Streamlit Community Cloud and connecting it to a GitHub repository, I demonstrate a clear understnading of how to take a machine learning project form local development to a fully shreable product. This project shows that I can operationalize models and build accessible applications around them - an increasingly important skill in modern machine learning roles. Then paired with my other projects, like a Jupyter data cleaning and EDA workflow, and a streamlit app focused ond ata visualization. This machine learning completes a well rounded portfolio. It really represents the intersection of machin learning and real world usability, a core focus of data science in practice.

## Project 4: Unsupervised App
This streamlit app provides an interactive envrionment for experimentingwith unsupervised machine learning models.User can upload their own datasets or select from built-in ones, choose between techniques like K-Means clustering and PCA, adjust hyperparameters, and visualize model performance through tools like elbow plots, sihouette scores, PCA projections, and component lodings. The app encourages hands-on exploration of unsupervised learning and clearly communicates results through responsive visuals.

### Insight:
Building this app deepend my understanding unsupervised learning concepts, including how clustering modesl behave with different dat scales, the trade offs in selecting the number of clusters, and how dimensionality reduction affetcs interpretability. It also emphasizes the importance of preprocessing, and how performance metrics guide moodel evaluation without labeled data.

### Portfolio Growth
This project compplements my existing portfolio by bridghing interctive front-end development via Streamlit with backened machine learning logic. While my previous projects demonstrated data cleaning and general purpose visual representations, this project show that I can:
- Implement real machine learning workflows
- Operationalize modesl in a usable interface
- Deploy tools that make complex techniques accessible
Together, these projects form a complete pipeline: data cleaning -> visualization -> model deployment. This app in particular illustrates how I can translate machine learning models into usable prodcut - a crucial step for real world data science applications
