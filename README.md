## Project 1: Streamlit App for Interactive Data Visualization
Streamlit is a Python library that allows users to build interactive web applications for data science and machine learning. It is very helpful in creating visualizations and interactive tools without additional knowledge about front-end development

### Features/Functions
* Interactive Options: Customized sliders, buttons, dropdowns, and more.
* Data Visualizations: Works with many Python libraries to generate visuals
* Simplicity: Easily writes web apps without additional scripts

## Project 2: Tidy Data Cleaning and Visualization 
This project focuses on transforming raw data into a tidy format for better analysis and visualization. Using the 2008 Olympics medalist dataset, the project applies data cleaning techniques and restructuring principles to ensure that:
* Each vairable is stored in its own column
* Each observation has its own row
* Each type of observational unit forms its own table

The project also includes data visualizations and aggregation techniques to showcase insights from the cleaned dataset. This project demonstrates strong data-wrangling skills and reinforces the importance of structured data for analysis.

## Portfolio Growth
Adding the Tidy Data project alongside the Streamlit App enhances this portfolio by demonstrating both backend data processing skills and frontend visualization capabilities. The first project showcases proficiency in data cleaning and transformation, while the second highlights the ability to build interactive applications. This combination strengthens the overall coding profile, making it more comprehensive and practical for real-world applications
